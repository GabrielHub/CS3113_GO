# CS3113_GO
Repo for CS3113 Intro to Game Programming

Final Project by Gabriel Ong:
	A, D for player 1 movement. W to jump, SPACE to fire bullet
	LEFT, RIGHT for player 2 movement. UP to jump, RCTRL to fire bullet

	Explanation:
	Both players have only one bullet. New bullets spawn only if both players have fired. Whoever wins 2 out of 3 maps wins.
